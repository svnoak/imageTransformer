# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - deploy

deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq lftp
    - lftp -c "set ftp:ssl-allow no; open -u $AKUKO_FTP_USERNAME,$AKUKO_FTP_PASSWORD $AKUKO_FTP_HOST; mirror -Rev dist/ /customers/0/6/4/akukoworld.com/httpd.www/images  --ignore-time --parallel=10 --exclude-glob .git* --exclude .git/"

    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
