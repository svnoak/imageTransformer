# productionImageCreation

This project was created as a quick and dirty way to bulk-edit images for an E-commerce business.

A lot of sellers online (Zalando, Amazon etc) do have specific requirements for product images regarding size, format and backgroundcolor.
Editing images on bulk either requires expensive software like Adobe Photoshop or a lot of time.

This code makes it possible for the user to input the specifications and bulk edit images.

Requirements:
PHP 8.0 or above

## To install
```
$git clone https://github.com/svnoak/imageTransformer.git
$cd imageTransformer
$php -S localhost:4000
```
Navigate to localhost:4000 in your webbrowser
