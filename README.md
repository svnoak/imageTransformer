# productionImageCreation

Creating product images based on an original according to saleschannel specifications.

## Usecase

E-Commerce sellers who use multiple saleschannels have to adapt their product images to each saleschannel's image specifikation.
In most cases this only means using a specific background color, certain minimum or maximum sizes and some times specific image ratios.

When needing to change these things, it is easier to set the settings and let the computer do the work for you, giving you time for other more meaningfull tasks or just to put your feet up for a while.
